      <button class = "accordion">How much do your camps cost?</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <br>
        <p>Code the Future's camps are completely free! We want everyone to have the access and opportunity to STEM education.</p>
      </div>
      <button class = "accordion">How will I know if my camper has been accepted?</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <br>
        <p>We will notify the camper's parent via email a few days prior to the camp. We are accepting students on a rolling basis.</p>
      </div>

      <button class = "accordion">Will my camper be able to understand the lessons, given no programming experience?</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <br>
      <p>Yes! Both our Scratch and HTML/CSS summer camps are meant for beginners. Given that the 3-week program is short, we believe it will be somewhat fast-paced. Regardless, campers will learn a lot during these weeks and are strongly encouraged to ask questions! </p>
      </div>

      <button class = "accordion">What does a typical day at camp look like?</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <br>
      <p>We will start each day at camp with reviewing and learning new material, with interactive questions to keep campers engaged. Afterwards, campers will apply their skills to create fun projects! Once finished, they will share out their creations.</p>
      </div>

      <button class = "accordion">My camper is outside the suggested grade range. Can he/she still apply?</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <br>
      <p>Definitely! These age ranges serve as a general guide for our camps.  If your camper does not mind working with campers who are younger/older, go ahead and apply!</p>
